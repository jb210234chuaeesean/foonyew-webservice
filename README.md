# Foon Yew High School new School EService Portal
This is a new concept of a school portal for unifying all the Foon Yew School Services (sso.foonyew.edu.my, attendance.foonyew.edu.my, fystudent.foonyew.edu.my, etc. ), for students, teachers and staffs to a single system, aiming for using the URL "https://account.foonyew.edu.my". 

## Project introduction & disclaimers
